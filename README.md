This project was made to as a part of the specialization post-graduation course to predict the next word.

# How to use:

- You should put the sherlock-holm.txt into your drive if you don't want to use the trained model.
- After that you can run the NextWordPrediction2.ipynb file and get the next words for the sentence you created before in seed_text.
- You can also you can use the trained model inside this repo for checking. It might need a new training depending on the time you arrived here.
- Please don't forget to train your model regularly.
- If you want to host this model on a API, please refer to this repo as sample [Host API](https://github.com/renatomateusx/Car_Purchase_Prediction_Amount)

# Preview (You can also find these information inside .ipynb file.)
